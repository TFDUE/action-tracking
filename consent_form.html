<h2> Information for participants </h2>
<p>
    This information sheet outlines the purpose of the data collection and provides a description of your involvement
    and rights as a participant, if you agree to take part.
</p>

<b>What is the research about? </b>
<p>
    With this extension we aim to gain information about different Jupyter notebook usage in online learning environments.
    Our goal is to gain insights with respect to intelligent learning systems. This extension is part of a Bachelor
    thesis for the University of Duisburg-Essen.
</p>

<b>Do I have to take part? </b>
<p>
    It is up to you to decide whether or not to take part. You do not have to take part if you do not want to. If you

    During active tracking your interactions within the notebooks will be registered, saved and sent to a server with
    the current notebook you're working on. The recorded interactions contain the time spent working on the notebook,
    the amounts of clicks ,created and deleted cells, copy and paste commands, cell executions, executions errors,
    key presses, mouse movement and scrolling.
